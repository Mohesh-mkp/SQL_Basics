## Important Note:

While updating a table in SQL, by default safe mode wil be enabled in MySQL in order to prevent unauthorized changes or to prevent any changes that may later be troubled.     
So table can not be updated until or unless we will make the safe mode off.    
So there is a direct command in SQL to enale or disable safe mode.    
```
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;   # To off the safe mode
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;   # To on the safe mode
```
