# Keys
To define special columns in the table we use the concept of key.    
They are of many types. A few of them are listed below;   
1. Primary Key
2. Foreign Key

### Primary Key:
- It's a column that holds unique values which is not similar to each other.
- A table can contain only one primary key.
- For example, In a student table id and roll number both are unique but we need to choose either of them as a primary key, whereas a Name that can be the same is not preferred to select as the primary key
- Primary key value can not be NULL, which means you can not put an empty value to the primary key holder row.

### Foreign Key:
- It's a column in a table that refers to a primary key.
- There can be multiple foreign keys present in a tale.
- These columns can have duplicate as well as NULL values.
